Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
 'a' happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 'b' happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 'c' happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 'd' happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
